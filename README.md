# terraform-google-gcloud

This module allows you to use gcloud, gsutil, any gcloud component, and jq in Terraform. Sometimes, there isn't Terraform GCP support for a particular feature, or you'd like to do something each time Terraform runs (ie: upload a file to a Kubernetes pod) that lacks Terraform support.

This module *does not* create any resources on GCP itself, rather exposes the GCP SDK to you for usage in null resources & external data resources.

## Usage

Basic usage of this module is as follows:

```hcl
module "gcloud" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/gcloud/google"
  version = "~> 2.0"

  platform = "linux"
  additional_components = ["kubectl", "beta"]

  create_cmd_entrypoint  = "gcloud"
  create_cmd_body        = "version"
  destroy_cmd_entrypoint = "gcloud"
  destroy_cmd_body       = "version"
}
```

Functional examples are included in the
[examples](./examples/) directory.

The [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) binary is also included in this module so you can use it as well for either of your `create_cmd_entrypoint` or `destroy_cmd_entrypoint` values.

## Downloading
By default, this module assumes you already have gcloud installed in your $PATH.

If you need to run Terraform in environments without a gcloud binary available, you can override this behavior by setting the `skip_download` variable to `false`.

You can also override the behavior by setting the `GCLOUD_TF_DOWNLOAD` environment variable.
This environment variable will override all other settings.
Setting it to `never` will *never* gcloud download and setting it to `always` will always download gcloud.

## Requirements

These sections describe requirements for using this module.

### Software

The following dependencies must be available:

- [Terraform][terraform] v0.12
- [Terraform Provider for GCP][terraform-provider-gcp] plugin v2.0
- [curl][curl]

### Service Account

A service account must be created, along with a key, to use this module.
The service account must have the proper IAM roles for whatever
commands you're running with this module.

### APIs

A project is not required to host resources of this module, since
this module does not create any resources.

However you will likely need a project for your service account
and any resources you'd like to interact with while using this module.
